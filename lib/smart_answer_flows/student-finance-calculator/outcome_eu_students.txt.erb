##Tuition costs

You could get a Tuition Fee Loan - <%= number_to_currency(tuition_fee_amount, precision: 0) %> per year.

The loan pays for the cost of your course and must be paid back.

<% if course_type == 'eu-full-time' %>
##Living costs

Most EU full-time students don't [qualify](/student-finance/who-qualifies) for help with living costs (known as 'maintenance').
<% else %>
##Living costs

EU part-time students don't qualify for help with living costs (known as 'maintenance').
<% end %>

##Extra help

You could get a [bursary or scholarship](/extra-money-pay-university) from your university or college. Usually, this doesn't have to be paid back.

Use the [Family Action grant search](http://www.family-action.org.uk/section.aspx?id=21211) to check whether you qualify for funding from a charitable trust.
