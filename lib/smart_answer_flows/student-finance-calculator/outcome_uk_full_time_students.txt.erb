^Your result is an estimate. Usually, you only get student finance if you’re doing your first higher education qualification - check if you [qualify](/student-finance/who-qualifies).^

##Extra help

You could get a [bursary or scholarship](/extra-money-pay-university) from your university or college.

You might be able to get [help with the costs of travel for study or work placements](/travel-grants-medical-dental-students-england) as part of your course.

Use the [Family Action grant search](http://www.family-action.org.uk/section.aspx?id=21211) to check whether you qualify for funding from a charitable trust.

^Student loans have to be paid back - grants, bursaries and allowances don’t.^
