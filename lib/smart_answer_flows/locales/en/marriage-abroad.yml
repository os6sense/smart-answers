          ###Getting a statutory declaration

          While you’re waiting for your CNI, you and your partner will need to make a statutory declaration before a [solicitor or public notary](http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/find-a-solicitor/). The Italian authorities will need this in addition to your CNI. There’s a standard template in English and Italian that you can download and use.

          ###Legalisation and translation

          You’ll need to get your statutory declaration and CNI '[legalised](/get-document-legalised)' (certified as genuine) by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO).

          You’ll also need to get your CNI [translated](/government/publications/italy-list-of-lawyers) and sworn before the Italian courts or an Italian Justice of the Peace.

          You can apply to get married at the British Embassy in Riyadh if you’re resident in Saudi Arabia and neither of you is a Muslim. Contact them to make an appointment.
          +[data_partial:overseas_passports_embassies:overseas_passports_embassies]
          You’ll need to provide:

          - proof that you’ve been living in the country where you intend to get married for at least 21 days, e.g. an employer’s letter or a bank statement (you’ll also need to sign a declaration to confirm this)
          - your original passport and [full birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) or [naturalisation certificate](/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate)
          - proof that you’re both over the age of 16, not within prohibited degrees of relationship to each other, and there’s no other impediment to your proposed marriage
          - equivalent document for your partner

          If either of you have been divorced, widowed or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need:

          - a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order), or
          - the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

          ###What happens next

          Once you’ve submitted these and paid the registration fee (see below), the embassy or consulate will post your marriage notice publicly for 14 days.

          As long as nobody has registered an objection after this time, the consular officer can then perform the marriage ceremony any time until 3 months after the date you gave notice.

          You’ll need to pay additional fees for the marriage ceremony and to get your marriage certificate (see below).

          You should also check if it needs to be:

          - ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine)
          - translated - [find a translator abroad](/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/series/list-of-lawyers), or in the UK through the [Institute of Linguists](http://www.iol.org.uk/linguist/translator1.asp?r=PCTXYL10046)

          You should also check with the local authorities to find out if you need to provide legalised and translated copies of any other documents.

          ^Your partner will need to follow the same process and pay the fees to get their own CNI.^

          %The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

          ##Fees

          You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees for %{country_name_lowercase_prefix}](/government/publications/%{ceremony_country}-consular-fees).

          You can pay by cash or credit card, but not by personal cheque.


        kosovo_not_uk_resident: |
          Contact the relevant local authorities in Kosovo to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

          You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.

          ##What you need to do

          You may be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

          If you need a CNI, you’ll have to give notice of your intended marriage in the country where you live.

          Check with your nearest British embassy or consulate to find out if they can do this for you.

          +[data_partial:overseas_passports_embassies:overseas_passports_embassies]

          You need to have been living in %{ceremony_country_name} for at least 3 days.

          You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:


          - your passport
          - your [full birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) or [naturalisation certificate](/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate)
          - proof of residence, such as a residence certificate - check with the embassy to find out what you need
          - equivalent documents for your partner

          If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

          - a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
          - a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
          - your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

          You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/series/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English.

          The embassy will provide you with forms for your notice of marriage, and an oath or affidavit (written statement of facts) stating that you’re free to marry. You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

          $D

          ##What happens next

          The embassy will charge a fee for taking the oath, and then display your notice of marriage publicly for a further 7 days. They’ll then issue the CNI, as long as nobody has registered an objection. There’s an additional fee for this.

          %The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

          You should check if your CNI needs to be legalised (certified as genuine) by the local authorities in Kosovo.

          ##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

          Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they've lived in the UK for 3 years.

          ##Fees

          ###The certificate of celibacy

          The tribunal might also ask you for a certificate of celibacy (‘certificat de célibat’) to prove you’re not already married or in a civil partnership. It’s not possible to provide this under UK law, so you’ll need to download the explanatory note and take this to the tribunal instead.
